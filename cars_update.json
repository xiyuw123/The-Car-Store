Fortuitously, a century ago, an aero-engine factory set up shop in Munich, at the foot of the Bavarian swath of these mountains, whereupon it started building motorcycles and later moved to automobiles.

In the Shelby GT350, though, the crank is the soul of the machine. It’s steel that’s forged and gun-drilled down its centerline to shave mass and relieve crankcase pressure. To that esti­mable piece of metal are attached eight connecting rods, the four crank throws spaced at 180-degree intervals instead of the traditional 90. This is more profoundly important than it might sound.",

Ignore the electric motors and Elon Musk’s Captain Planet sermons. Really, just try to wipe what you know about the car from your mind. Even in this context, the Model S still points a spotlight on the auto industry’s complacency.",

We understand if the inclusion of the Volks­wagen Golf in this year’s 10Best, its 10th in a row, causes surprise, incredulity, or even the sort of sputtering indignation normally only displayed by raging lieutenants in buddy-cop movies.
